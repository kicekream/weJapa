ABOUT PROJECT

This is weJapa Internship Project(s), to be updated as the project goes on.

1. week0_Task is a task about creating a Node server (GET and POST request) without any framework.
Clone the repo and goto the project folder
Set PROCESS.ENV.PORT or leave port 3000 open to start the server
Run node "app.js" minus the quotes
Testing the Endpoints, use Postman or Postwoman:

a.  GET / : localhost:port/ directs you to Hello World

b.  POST / : localhost:port/, input name as follows: 
  {
	"name": "yourName"
  }  
  Note: Even if 100 key value pairs are sent, only name would be selected.
  
  Any other endpoint asides the two endpoints would return an error 404.
